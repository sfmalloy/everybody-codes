# *Everybody Codes* - Story 1 Solutions

These are my solutions to Story 1 - [*Echos of Enigmatus*](https://everybody.codes/story/1/quests) written in JavaScript.

## Running
The solutions use NodeJS. There is a `package.json` but you don't need to `npm install` anything if you don't want NodeJS library types/autocomplete.

You will however need to download inputs manually and save them to the `inputs/` directory. There is one subdirectory for each quest. So `inputs/quest1` should contain `part1.in`, `part2.in`, and `part3.in`.

Finally to run, it's simply:
```bash
node run.js
```

Normally I like to make fancy command-line interfaces for running single quests and stories but I haven't done that this time around. So running `run.js` will simply run all parts of all quests.
